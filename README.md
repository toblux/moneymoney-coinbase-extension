# MoneyMoney Coinbase Extension

This MoneyMoney extension lists your Coinbase wallets and balances.

## Installation

Installing MoneyMoney extensions is documented [here](https://moneymoney-app.com/extensions/) (scroll down to **Installation**).

To use this extension, you have to **create a Coinbase API key** with read-only permissions, which is documented [here](https://help.coinbase.com/exchange/managing-my-account/how-to-create-an-api-key).

Finally, add a new Coinbase account in MoneyMoney with **Account > Add Account > Other > Coinbase Account** and enter your **API key name** and your **EC private key** (copy both values in full, including any newline characters such as `\n`).

## Rationale and features

I was happy with [Martin Wilhelmi's](https://github.com/mnin/coinbase-moneymoney) and [Felix Nensa's](https://github.com/luckfamousa/coinbase-moneymoney) extensions, but they're either no longer maintained or just didn't work for me anymoreâ€”mainly because paging isn't implemented and cryptocurrencies like cbETH are missing (at least as of December 2024).

This MoneyMoney extension is inspired by both and adds the following features:

- Unlimited number of wallets (by handling paginated API responses)
- Starting with v1.02, balances on hold are listed separately
- Starting with v1.04, staked assets are working again
